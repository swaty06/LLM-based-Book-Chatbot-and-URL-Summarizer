# LLM-based Book Chatbot and URL Summarizer

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), including OpenAI's API and Google PaLM, to create an intelligent chatbot and a URL summarizer focused on books. The primary objective of this project is to enhance the reading experience by providing book suggestions and in-depth insights from various online resources.

## Features:

### 1. Book Recommendation Chatbot
- This chatbot is designed to assist users in finding their next great read. You can simply ask the chatbot questions about books, such as "What should I read next?" or "Can you recommend a good mystery novel?" and it will provide tailored book suggestions based on a vast database of literary works. There's no need to specify your interestsâ€”the chatbot will handle the rest!

### 2. URL Summarizer for Book-Related Content
- The URL Summarizer is a powerful tool that allows users to paste URLs related to a specific book. The summarizer then processes these URLs, extracting key information and insights, which can be queried by the user. This feature is particularly useful for readers and researchers who want to delve deeper into a book's content, reviews, critiques, or any other relevant online material. You can ask questions about the book based on the provided URLs, making it a comprehensive tool for book analysis.

## Technology Stack:

- **LLMs Integration:**
  - Utilizes OpenAI's API and Google PaLM to provide natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
  
- **OpenAPI:**
  - The project is built using OpenAPI standards to ensure robust API design, allowing seamless integration and scalability.

## Use Cases:

### For Book Enthusiasts:
- Ask the chatbot directly for book recommendations without needing to provide prior information about your interests.
- Explore detailed insights from multiple online resources about a book you are interested in.

### For Researchers and Academics:
- Quickly summarize and query content from various URLs to gather diverse perspectives on a book.
- Use the chatbot to discover related literature and expand your research.

## How to Use:

### 1. Book Chatbot
- Simply ask the chatbot questions like "What should I read next?" or request recommendations for specific genres, and it will provide you with tailored book suggestions.

### 2. URL Summarizer
- Input the URLs related to the book you are researching or interested in. Ask specific questions to extract the information you need.
